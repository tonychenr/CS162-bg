Using objdump with the -D flag on the map executable. Which of the addresses from the output
of running ./map are defined in the executable, and which segment is each defined in?
main is in the .text segment. recur is in the .text segment. static data is in the .data section. 

Make a list of the important segments, and what they are used for (look up their names on the
Internet if you donâ€™t know).
.text: This segment holds the instructions
.bss: This segment holds uninitialized global and static variables.
.data: This segment holds initialized global and static variables.
.rodata: This holds read-only data, such as constants and string literals.
.interp: This segments loads and links shared libraries required by the executable.
.plt: This segment is the relocation table that connects symbolic references with symbolic definitions, such as when a function is called.

What direction is the stack growing in?
The stack grows downward (decreasing).

How large is the stack frame for each recursive call?
48 bytes.

Where is the heap? What direction is it growing in?
The heap is at 0x1295010. It grows upward (increasing).

Are the two malloc()ed memory areas contiguous? (e.g. is there any extra space between their
addresses?)
There are 12 address spaces between the 2 areas.
