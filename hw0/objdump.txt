What file format is used for this binary? And what architecture is it compiled for?
elf64-x86-64 is file format.  x86-64 is the architecture.

What are some of the names of segments you find?
Some segments are .text, .data, .comment, .debug_info, .init, and .bss. There are 30 segments total.


What segment contains main (the function) and what is the address of main? (It should be the
same as what you saw in gdb)
.text section holds main. The address is 0x400808.

Do you see the stack segment anywhere? What about the heap? Explain.
I don't see the stack or heap segment. This is because the stack and heap are allocated during runtime and stored in memory.
